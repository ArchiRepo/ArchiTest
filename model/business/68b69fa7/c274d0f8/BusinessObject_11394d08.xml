    documentation="The Operational Information element is used to describe the information the service needs to handle to fulfil its PURPOSE, information needed to ensure we can RUN the service is handled elsewhere. Operational Information should be described in enough detail to describe the PURPOSE of the service, this information may come directly from the domain model if this information domain has already been explored there, its structure will be influenced by the domain model if it has not already been covered there.&#xD;&#xA;NOTE this is an incremental way to develop the Information Domains - this requires the intended architecture of the domains to be defined."/>
